          As an enthusiastic Full Stack Developer, I bring a wealth of knowledge
          in a variety of programming languages. I have practical experience working with
          PHP, TypeScript, and JavaScript, as well as with React and Next.js.
          Although my preference is frontend development, I also enjoy working
          on the backend.
